# Mohafadati – Object-Oriented Modeling of ANCFCC Services 🇲🇦

A full system modeling project representing the services of the **Agence Nationale de la Conservation Foncière, du Cadastre et de la Cartographie (ANCFCC)**. Designed using UML and the 2TUP methodology, with a proposed implementation stack using Java Spring Boot, AngularJS, and PostgreSQL.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project reverse-engineers and models the digital service ecosystem of the Moroccan land registry authority (ANCFCC). It includes:
- Static and dynamic modeling using UML 2.0
- Identification of use cases and classes
- Technical architecture design
- Proposed front-end, back-end, and database technologies
- Mockup of key interfaces for citizen and professional users

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand user journeys and services like title certification, cadastral maps, and document authenticity.
- Model real-world land services digitally using an object-oriented approach.
- Propose a secure, scalable architecture for deployment.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- UML 2.0 (class, sequence, state diagrams)  
- Methodology: 2TUP (Two-Track Unified Process)  
- Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA  
- AngularJS  
- PostgreSQL  
- JWT for stateless authentication

## 📚 Academic Context

- Developed by: Zakaria Douih, Mohammed Belmellah, Abderrahmane Nait-El-Haj, Yassir Fahimi  
- Supervised by: Mme Rajaa Saidi  
- Institution: INSEA – Filière DSE  
- Academic Year: 2024–2025

## 📂 Structure

📁 documentation/ → Project report, UML diagrams
📁 frontend/ → AngularJS mockups
📁 backend/ → Spring Boot model structure (planned)
📁 db/ → ERD & Logical model for PostgreSQL

## 🧠 Highlights

- Formal use case analysis and class responsibility assignment  
- Complete user modeling for citizens, professionals, and employees
